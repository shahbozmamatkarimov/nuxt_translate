        Remember the days when you couldn’t find the proper translation of an
        English word to the Uzbek language? I also know those feelings when you
        run against the lack of general use dictionaries - not to mention the
        specialized ones, a total absence of online resources in Uzbek, a
        pre-requisite of knowing the Russian language in order to apply indirect
        translation (EN RU UZ and vice versa).

          To reverse the situation, it was decided to compile a large
          English-Uzbek-English dictionary and the work started back in 2003. 2
          years later, the first edition of the bilingual dictionary was
          published in G’afur G’ulom publishing house; it is still available for
          sale online. Much attention was directed to the Uzbek-English part;
          even now, it is the most comprehensive and complete UZ-EN dictionary.
          A mobile app for Android devices was launched based on the dictionary
          with ma jor update of the lexical database.

          However, we still desperately needed a high-quality online dictionary
          for English-Uzbek language pair that could cover both everyday and
          area-specific vocabulary. In September 2022, on the date of 31th
          anniversary of Independence of Uzbekistan, Leksika.uz was successfully
          launched. Leksika.uz has mainly been designed to give English learners
          of any level the help they need to read, speak and write English more
          effectively. It is also intended to assist translators and localizers
          by providing useful tips and rules of thumb; these can be found in
          Localization section.
